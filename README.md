# mQuiz

This is app developed in Android studio.
This is simple Quiz app with SQLite database with questions and users (highscore).
The app has a features like Admin mode where you can add your own questions by hitting correct password, 
every question has its own "difficulty" ,it means when you hit a wrong answer, question percentage gets lower and it becomes "hard question" 
and vice versa. This is my school project so there are no many questions (around 30).
At the end, you can share your score on your Facebook account with the photo of my app's simple logo.
