This is android app mQuiz. It is simple quiz app with 40 questions, not many because this is my college project. At the end of the quiz, you can share your score with app's simple logo on Facebook. Every question has set its own difficulty, when answer is missed, question becomes "Hard question". Question can be "hard", "medium" and "easy" depending on the percentage of correct answers. There is admin mode too, where you can add new questions if you guess correct password. Every player can see whole higscore list with all players and their scores.
